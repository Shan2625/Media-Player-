Hardware Requirements for a Raspberry Pi Project

This project is designed to run on a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** and is controlled using physical buttons connected to its GPIO pins. Here's a structured breakdown of the required and recommended hardware, along with the specific GPIO pin assignments.

Required Compnents

Raspberry Pi 4 Model B: The core computing unit.
MicroSD Card (16GB or larger): Used for the operating system (Raspberry Pi OS) and to store all your media files.
HDMI Display (TV or Monitor): A screen for displaying the media output.
3 Momentary Push Buttons: These buttons are used to switch between image, video, and playlist modes.
Male-to-Female Jumper Wires: For connecting the push buttons to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and ground.
Power Supply (5V 3A):A reliable power source for the Raspberry Pi.
Breadboard: To test and use the GPIO buttons.
External Speakers: Needed for audio playback if you're using video media.



GPIO Pin Assignments (BCM Numbering)

This project uses internal pull-up resistors, so no external resistors are needed for the buttons. When a button is pressed, its corresponding GPIO pin is pulled to a low state.

Image Mode Button:Connect one side of the button to GPIO pin 17 and the other side to a ground (GND) pin.
Video Mode Button: Connect one side of the button to GPIO pin 27 and the other side to a ground (GND) pin.
Playlist Mode Button: Connect one side of the button to GPIO pin 22 and the other side to a ground (GND) pin.
