## Required Components

| Component                      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B | Main computing unit with GPIO and HDMI support                              |
| MicroSD Card (16GB or larger) | Storage for Raspberry Pi OS and media files                                |
| HDMI Display (TV/Monitor)     | Fullscreen media output device                                              |
| 3 x Momentary Push Buttons    | For switching between image, video, and playlist modes via GPIO            |
| Male-to-Female Jumper Wires   | To connect buttons to GPIO pins and ground                                 |
| Power Supply (5V 3A recommended) | To power the Raspberry Pi reliably                                         |

## Recommended Accessories

| Component              | Description                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Breadboard             | For prototyping GPIO circuits without soldering           |
| Resistors (10kÎ©)       | Optional pull-down resistors for extra button stability   |
| USB Keyboard/Mouse     | For debugging and ESC key input (optional after setup)    |
| USB Audio Adapter      | If analog audio output is needed with better quality      |
| Heatsink/Fan Case      | For thermal management during extended use                |
| External Speakers      | If using analog or HDMI audio for video playback          |

## GPIO Pin Assignments (BCM Numbering)

| Button Function  | GPIO Pin (BCM) | Connection Notes                        |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Image Mode       | 17             | Connect one side to GPIO 17, other to GND |
| Video Mode       | 27             | Connect one side to GPIO 27, other to GND |
| Playlist Mode    | 22             | Connect one side to GPIO 22, other to GND |

> Buttons use internal pull-up resistors; no external pull-ups are needed. When pressed, the GPIO pin is pulled LOW.
